# LogBuddy

LogBuddy is a helper tool for reading log files. It has features to:

- combine multiple log files
- sort them however you want
- filter out logs by who performed the action, where it happened
- filter out logs that a person couldn't have heard or seen
- work with multiple filters (filter the filtered output)
- write the resulting set to a file

## Currently supported log files

- game.txt
- attack.txt
- pda.txt
- silicon.txt

## Running

To run:

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python main.py`

Optionally:

- `python main.py logs`, where `./logs/` is a folder that contains logs (all will
be parsed)

I recommend creating a virtual environment, but it's not necessary. If you don't
know how to do it, you probably don't need to worry about it. If you run into
strange issues, start worrying about it.

Optionally, you can provide a log file, or folder with multiple log files.
The script will automatically load those in. You also manually do it later.
